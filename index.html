            <h3>Reaching the unreachable</h3>

            <p class="para">In Kenya, some 300 km south of Nairobi, along the common Kenyan/Tanzanian border, lie the rolling hills of Loita, home of some 20,000 Loita Pastoralist Maasai, a subset of the Maasai Community.The region is remote and effectively without infrastructure. This, combined with the Loita’s traditional reputation as the most conservative of the Maasai, has contributed to their status as one of the ‘unreachable’ people of the world.The life of the Maasai revolves around their cattle and in a country where land is becoming scarce and a constant  source of conflict a project of land management and livestock upgrading has proven life-saving and a source of reconciliation with surrounding communities.</p>

      	    <p class="para">The Ilkerin Loita Integral Development Programme is owned and managed by the pastoralist Loita community. It covers an area of 1700 sq.km. The programme has its origin in a dialogue between the Catholic Diocese of Ngong and the Loita Maasai pastoralists, which took place in 1968. After years of talks, friendship-making and exchanging the latest developments which the Maasai call ‘eating the news’, an agreement was reached.During this period the project’s basic philosophy was defined. It stemmed from the simple belief that with appropriate training, motivation and skills, communities are capable of using available and potential resources in order to transform and improve their present and future  lives.Thirty-five years on the Ilkerin Loita Integral Development Project remains a showcase for real sustainability and what a community can do for itself! </p>

             <h3>LIVESTOCK PROGRAM</h3>

              <p class="para">The life of the Maasai revolves around their cattle. Therefore any change in their culture must take this fundamental truth into consideration.In 1972 a dutch priest, Father Jan Voshaar, pitched a tent in the plains of Ilkerin. Working hand-in-hand with the Loita pastoralists, a project for sustainable development was born.The Loita pastoralists set aside a 3,100 acre piece of land and cut 19 km of road to the project site. They also donated 60 heifers to help set up the livestock improvement and upgrading programme. They offered free labour and a small fund to meet the project expenses.</p>

           <div class="col-md-4">
              <img class="img-circle" src="images/drinkbak.jpg" width="150" height="150">
              <p class="para">One of the first jobs Father Voshaar and the Loita Maasai undertook was to build two dams in small valleys near the project. During the rainy seasons these dams allow two artificial lakes to fill and thus ensure that there is water in the dry season. As the semi-nomadic existence of the Maasai revolves around the search for water for their cattle, this brought an immediate solution.In a country where land is becoming scarce and a constant source of conflict, it has proven life-saving and even a source of reconciliation.In 2006 Kenya suffered a serious drought but the lakes still carried water and pastoralists from all the surrounding communities came with their herds to drink</p>

           	  <img class="img-circle" src="images/858.jpg" width="150" height="150">
           	  <p class="para">For the Maasai, livestock is the source and measure of wealth and the expression of cultural identity and loyalty.The Loita community donated the land and the original heifers that formed the seed of what is now a 3100 acre ranch operating 350 sahiwal cattle, 300 dorper sheep and 350 galla goats.The upgrading programme started when the Ilkerin-Loita project bought two good quality Sahiwall bulls. They then asked the community to bring their heifers to mate with the bulls.This original ‘heifer bond’ cemented relations between the community and the Project. With better breeding stock and veterinary care Loita herds produced more milk, grew at a faster rate and fetched more money at the market than those of their neighbours</p>

           <div class="col-md-4">
           	<img class="img-circle" src="images/jongenmelkfles.jpg" width="150" height="150">
           	<p class="para" id="p2">Many farmers from Narok and Kajiado have greatly benefited by buying the project’s stock for their own crossbreeding and upgrading.The Ilkerin Loita Project farm serves as a showcase for all aspects of traditional and modern animal husbandry practices and techniques for local farmers. Livestock marketing is promoted and a local weekly livestock market is in operation at Olmesuti market.Through its livestock programme the project has been able to support and improve the livelihood of the local pastoralists. The local livestock has become more productive and resilient and, as a result, the community’s economy has been strengthened.</p>
           </div>
             

             <p class="para">The project runs a community-based Veterinary Care programme which covers 5 locations. This programme consists of a mobile vet, six livestock medication shops, cattle dips, group hand-spray pumps and agricultural training sessions.The programme works closely with existing governmental veterinary services as well as traditional systems, and helps carry out local vaccinations, inoculations and immunisation campaigns.Livestock diseases are now under control throughout the area of operation.The local pastoralists run 5 small scale dairy co-operatives which process milk into cream, butter and ghee which can be stored for a longer period of time.It can then be sold locally, especially during the dry season when there is less milk.</p>

          <h3>Governance, Management and legal Status</h3>
          <p class="para">The Project is run by a 20 member Board of Elders, and managed by a team of local professional staff.The board is representative of the key stake holders: the Loita Council of Elders, the Loita Women Council, the Loita Youth Associations, the Grassroots Pastoralists Community Development Associations, Local and Central Government, the Diocese of Ngong and external independent experts.The Diocese of Ngong is the appointed legal holder, but the Loita Maasai have always remained the de facto owners of the ILIDP.This innovative legal arrangement has enabled the project to realize and exercise their mandate in an all inclusive and harmonious manner.</p>
       <div class="col-md-3">
       	   <h4>Cultural Value</h4>
       	   <p class="para">Culture could be defined as the accumulated and tested experience as well as the established ways of doing things in a given community.At this moment the culture of the Loita Maasai pastoralist is still largely intact. He still has a proven source of livelihood and access to his ancestral land.However, today the Maasai pastoralist is a poor and marginalized minority group. They are faced with a myriad of problems including poverty, loss of land, cultural disintegration, economic exploitation and political oppression. Also they are still victims of western piecemeal development rhetoric and experimentation.Very often the pastoralist capability and ways of doing things are generally ignored. They are often treated as the participants rather then the main actors of their own development. The result is that the so called development tends to weaken their accumulated knowledge and intends to replace the Maasai way of doing things.</p>

       <div class="col-md-3">
       	   <h4>Ritualising Development and Community Spirit.</h4>
       	   <p class="para">In the Maasai culture any new reality has to be ritualised through a series of ceremonies and rites of passage before they can own it. Through such rituals the new reality is made to acquire all the aspects of the Maasai culture. Only by this process the new reality takes a familiar and acceptable form which can be adapted and sustained by he community.The Loita Community believe in maintaining and sustaining a communal way of life.It is their believe that the community members should live in harmony, are mutual supportive and inter-dependent in the realisation of general life tasks.</p>
       	 
       	    <h4>Health Care</h4>
       	    <p class="para">The project has helped to build 4 dispensaries in the 5 administrative sections of Loita. It runs an ambulance service and mobile clinic which operates in the remote parts of Loiota.The health care program works closely and hand in hand with the traditional healers and herbalists.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="col-md-3">
       	    <h4>Pastrolist community training</h4>
       	    <p class="para">The project runs a pastoralist Training Centre with the necessary facilities. It can cater up to 40 pastoralists a day. The trainings are in the relevant fields and are offered to local farmers and pastoralists.</p>
       	   
       	    <h4>Women Program Activities.</h4>
       	    <p class="para">One of the Projects objectives is to promote and raise gender awareness and the general welfare of the women of Loita The project has helped to start and run 7 women groups in all of the Loita locations. These women groups are engaged in various activities including beaded handicrafts, milk processing, hides and skins marketing and subsitance agriculture. Most of the members of these groups enroll in adult literacy classes. The project now employs one full time program officer and as a result the women groups are much more active and efficient</p>
       </div>
       <div class="col-md-3">
       	    <h4>Agriculture Development</h4>
       	    <p class="para">The Maasai believe that all the cattle, wherever they are, belong to them. Therefore when they go on cattle raids, they are simply taking back what belongs to them.However, obviously this practise these days borders at the impossible.The morans get wounded or even killed in the raids and other communities view the Maasai as enemies.The Ilkerin-Loita project looked for a solution.The solution was raiding the soil instead of the cattle.Morans started growing maize in small gardens around the manyattas (maasai villages).Over the years this initiative has grown to a full-scale food production. As a result, if the weather condition allows, the Loita Community now grows up to 60% of their grain requirement themselves instead of purchasing it from the shops.The Ilkerin-Loita Project runs a programme to teach the pastoralists proper land use and management.</p>
